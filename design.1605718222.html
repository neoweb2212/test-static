<h1>The Truth About Design Thinking</h1><img align="left" alt="design" src="https://i.imgur.com/lSXmqxp.jpg" style="max-width:31% width:auto; margin:0px 10px; height:auto; max-height:356px;"> <p>Design thinking can turn into creative, redesign, and make more engaged and innovative employees. It's, according to an informal survey of senior plan leaders in 2020, one of the hottest new resources for effective business planning. Now that sounds great, right? But how does it really work? Well, if you're like most of us, it doesn't. There are a number of problems with designing through the eyes of management, most notably:</p> <p></p> <p>- Management tends to view a "design" as an abstract symbol, usually a brand, logo, or color scheme. It doesn't involve real people and the reality of how it is used (e.g., what it is made from, where it is made, how it is used, etc.). This means that when the design is complete, it is only as good as the first person who conceptualized it. (No one is ever able to "see" the design until they see it - which is why most "designers" don't have portfolios or examples to show to clients.) A design is a tool, which should be used creatively and imaginatively, as opposed to simply as a tool. And since the tool is just an abstract symbol, it can easily be taken out of context by the public, especially those who work in sales or the media. Because of this, a well-designed design is rarely shared widely or used by others as a template for their own design.</p> <p></p> <p>- As I alluded to above, designers don't tend to share their work with other companies or design marketing materials. This means that most of us are never exposed to the ideas behind a design. In most cases, we only see the design once and then only through a designer's words.</p> <iframe width="510" height="285" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqQx75OPRa0" style="margin:0px auto; display: block;"></iframe>
